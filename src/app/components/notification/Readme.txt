Readme.txt

This page should collect basic information about the CouchDB and display them to the user
ex: 
- Nbr Of docs
- Status of certain docs (New, In progress, Completed). 
- Docs that need attention

Click will trigger a event on the other page to filter them.

How to do that: 
have 1 mapReduce in the CouchDB that get all the information needed for that page. 


TODO:
Create tests
Make it pretty
Create the link across pages.
